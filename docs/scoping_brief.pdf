## 1. Use Case

### Business Context
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile with rapid price movements that create both opportunities and risks for traders. The ability to detect volatility spikes in real-time (within 60 seconds) enables:
- Risk management through early warning systems
- Algorithmic trading strategy triggers
- Market surveillance and monitoring

### Target Users
- Cryptocurrency traders (retail and institutional)
- Risk management teams
- Market makers and liquidity providers

## 2. Problem Statement

**Objective:** Predict short-term volatility spikes in cryptocurrency prices 60 seconds ahead of occurrence.

**Definition of Volatility Spike:** A price movement exceeding X% (e.g., 0.5-1.0%) within a 60-second window, OR a standard deviation spike above the 90th percentile of recent volatility distribution.

**Input:** Real-time ticker data from Coinbase (BTC-USD, ETH-USD)
- Price (best bid, best ask, last trade)
- Volume
- 24-hour high/low

**Output:** Binary classification (0 = normal volatility, 1 = spike detected)

---

## 3. Success Metrics

### Primary Metric
**Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC):** Due to class imbalance (volatility spikes are rare events), we prioritize PR-AUC over ROC-AUC.

**Target:** PR-AUC ≥ 0.70

### Secondary Metrics
- **Precision @ 0.5 threshold:** Minimize false alarms
- **Recall @ 0.5 threshold:** Capture majority of true spikes
- **Latency:** Inference must complete in < 2x real-time (< 120 seconds for 60-second windows)

### Business Impact
- Reduce unexpected losses from volatile price movements
- Enable proactive position adjustment
- Improve overall risk-adjusted returns

## 4. Prediction Horizon & Labeling Strategy

**Prediction Horizon:** 60 seconds (1 minute)

**Label Generation:**
1. Calculate rolling standard deviation of midprice returns over next 60 seconds
2. Set threshold τ at 90th percentile of historical volatility distribution
3. Label = 1 if σ_future ≥ τ, else 0

**Justification:** 60 seconds provides actionable lead time while maintaining sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.

## 5. Risk Assumptions & Constraints

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket disconnections:** Implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- **Data latency:** Coinbase API delays could impact prediction accuracy
- **Feature drift:** Market regimes change; model requires regular retraining

### Data Assumptions
- Tick data frequency: ~1-10 updates per second (varies by trading activity)
- Feature window: Use 5-10 minute rolling windows for historical context
- Prediction window: 60 seconds forward-looking
- Train/validation/test split: Time-based (70/15/15) to prevent data leakage

### Operational Constraints
- No trading execution (analysis only)
- Public market data only
- Real-time processing requirement: Features must be computable in streaming fashion

---

## 6. Model Development Plan

### Baseline Model
Z-score based rule: Trigger alert when recent volatility exceeds 2 standard deviations

### ML Models (at least one)
- Logistic Regression with engineered features
- XGBoost classifier (optional)

### Feature Engineering
- Rolling statistics: mean, std, min, max of returns
- Bid-ask spread dynamics
- Trade intensity (volume-weighted)
- Optional: Order book imbalance if data available

---

## 7. Evaluation Strategy

### Cross-Validation
Time-series split with walk-forward validation

### Test Set
Final 15% of data (held out), representing most recent market conditions

### Monitoring
- Evidently reports for data drift detection
- Performance metrics logged to MLflow
- Regular retraining cadence (weekly recommended)

## Summary

This project builds a real-time volatility detection system for cryptocurrency markets using streaming data from Coinbase. Success will be measured primarily by PR-AUC ≥ 0.70, with operational requirements for low latency (<2x real-time) and robust handling of data quality issues.
